            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This report outlines my professional journey and contributions as the Assistant Manager at the Directorate of Sports, GITAM University, during the six months from February to July 2024. The report is structured in two distinct phases, reflecting the evolving nature of my role and responsibilities over this time.</p>

                    <h3>Phase 1: Observing, Learning, and Adaptation (February â€“ April 2024)</h3>
                </div>
                <p>During the initial three months, my primary focus was observing and understanding the existing sports programs, facilities, and administrative operations at the Directorate of Sports. This period allowed me to become acquainted with the internal processes, gain insight into the university's sports culture, and establish relationships with key stakeholders, including coaches, athletes, and administrative staff. Throughout this phase, I concentrated on learning the specific needs and challenges of the department, as well as identifying areas for improvement. Adaptation was key during this phase as I began to tailor my approach to align with the university's objectives and the dynamic needs of the student-athletes.</p>

                    <h3>Phase 2: Planning and Execution (May â€“ July 2024)</h3>
                </div>
                <p>In the second phase, I shifted from learning and observation to strategic planning and execution. Building on the insights gathered during the first three months, I initiated the process of implementing improvements in sports event management, facility usage, and team coordination. This phase saw the execution of various sports programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing student engagement and fostering a more structured approach to sports development at the university. I also worked closely with the leadership body and SSAs (Student Sports Assistants) to organize major events and streamline operations, ensuring that GITAM sports functions smoothly and effectively.</p>
                <p>This two-phased approach enabled me to systematically integrate into my role, understand the department's goals, and contribute meaningfully to the growth of the university's sports culture. The following sections provide a detailed account of my responsibilities, achievements, challenges, and plans during these six months.</p>
