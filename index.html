        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This report outlines my professional journey and contributions as the Assistant Manager at the Directorate of Sports, GITAM University, during the six months from February to July 2024. The report is structured in two distinct phases, reflecting the evolving nature of my role and responsibilities over this time.</p>

            <!-- Phase 1 Section -->
            <div class="phase" id="phase1">
                <div class="phase-header">
                    <span class="phase-icon">📘</span>
                    <h3>Phase 1: Observing, Learning, and Adaptation (February – April 2024)</h3>
                </div>
                <p>During the initial three months, my primary focus was observing and understanding the existing sports programs, facilities, and administrative operations at the Directorate of Sports. This period allowed me to become acquainted with the internal processes, gain insight into the university's sports culture, and establish relationships with key stakeholders, including coaches, athletes, and administrative staff. Throughout this phase, I concentrated on learning the specific needs and challenges of the department, as well as identifying areas for improvement. Adaptation was key during this phase as I began to tailor my approach to align with the university's objectives and the dynamic needs of the student-athletes.</p>

                <h4 id="learning-guidelines">Learning the GITAM Sports Guidelines:</h4>
                <p>The Student Sports Associates (SSAs) were invaluable in guiding me through the foundational aspects of GITAM Sports, from its history to its present-day operations. They explained the guidelines and procedures, helping me understand how the department functions both administratively and operationally. This initial guidance helped me grasp the essence of GITAM Sports and its workflows.</p>

                <h4 id="observing-workflows">Observation of Departmental Workflows:</h4>
                <p>By closely observing the workflows within GITAM Sports, I gained insights into processes such as event management, coordination between directorates, and the structure of student leaders' involvement. I focused on understanding the outcomes of these processes and how each component contributed to the broader goals of the Directorate of Sports.</p>

                <h4 id="collaboration">Inter-Directorate Collaboration:</h4>
                <p>Through interactions with other managers, I gained a deeper understanding of how the Directorate of Sports (DoS) collaborates with other departments like Hospitality, Security, and AVS. I observed how these collaborations ensured the success of sports events, and I adapted to these workflows to integrate GITAM Sports' needs into the university's broader operations.</p>

                <h4 id="learning-challenges">Learning from Challenges:</h4>
                <p>During this phase, I encountered some challenges adjusting to the new environment. However, with the guidance and support of other managers and the SSAs, I quickly rectified these issues. Each challenge presented an opportunity to learn and refine my approach, helping me become a more effective member of the team.</p>

            <!-- Phase 2 Section -->
            <div class="phase" id="phase2">
                <div class="phase-header">
                    <span class="phase-icon">📊</span>
                    <h3>Phase 2: Planning and Execution (May – July 2024)</h3>
                </div>
                <p>In the second phase, I shifted from observation to strategic planning and execution. Building on the insights gathered in the first three months, I implemented improvements in sports event management, facility usage, and team coordination. This phase saw the execution of various sports programs aimed at enhancing student engagement and fostering a structured approach to sports development at the university.</p>

                <h4 id="managing-goodies">Managing the Goodies for the GS Awards:</h4>
                <p>One of my key tasks was procuring goodies for the GITAM Sports (GS) Awards. With a constrained budget, I explored cost-effective options while maintaining quality. I worked closely with the SSAs and GSC to ensure proper planning and execution, delivering on this key component under the guidance of my manager.</p>

                <h4 id="vendor-management">Vendor Selection and Budget Management:</h4>
                <p>Given the budget limitations, I explored alternatives to the regular GITAM vendors. After negotiating with new vendors, I successfully secured a vendor that provided quality goodies at a favorable price. This experience improved my vendor management and budget planning skills.</p>

                <h4 id="handling-time">Handling Time Constraints:</h4>
                <p>With a short deadline, I coordinated closely with vendors and internal teams to ensure timely delivery of the goodies for the GS Awards Show. Despite the tight timeline, all items were delivered on time, which required clear communication and efficient planning.</p>

                <h4 id="financial-processes">Learning Financial Processes at GITAM:</h4>
                <p>During this phase, I navigated GITAM’s financial processes, working with the Finance Department to manage payments and approvals. This task provided valuable insights into the financial workflow, including documentation and budget management, which will be crucial for future projects.</p>
